# Brain

The `brain/` directory is an Obsidian vault — persistent memory across sessions.

- **Read first.** Read brain files relevant to your task before acting.
- **Write** after mistakes, corrections, or notable codebase learnings.
- **Structure:** One topic per file. Directories with `[[wikilink]]` indexes — no inlined content.
- **Maintain:** Delete outdated notes and stale artifacts.
