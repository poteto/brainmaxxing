# Subtract Before You Add

When evolving a system, remove complexity first, then build. Deletion creates a simpler substrate that makes subsequent additions cleaner, smaller, and less error-prone.

**Why:** Adding to a complex system compounds complexity. Removing first reduces the surface area, reveals the essential structure, and makes the addition's design more obvious. The default action should be subtraction.

**The Pattern:**
- Sequence removal before construction
- Cut before you polish (ruthlessly cut to minimum before investing in quality)
- Design for observed usage, not speculative edge cases
- Simplify prompts (remove redundant instructions, excessive templates)
- When a reference has no novel content, delete it rather than leaving a stub

This is about *when* to act — an ordering principle that says subtraction comes before addition.
