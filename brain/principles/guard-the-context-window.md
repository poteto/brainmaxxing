# Guard the Context Window

The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token that enters should earn its place.

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, causes compression artifacts, and halts progress. Unlike compute or time, context consumed within a session cannot be reclaimed.

**Pattern:**
- **Isolate large payloads:** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to subagents. The main context gets summaries, not raw data
- **Don't read what you won't use:** Read selectively based on relevance. If a file isn't needed for the current task, skip it
- **Keep frequently-used content inline:** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time
- **Size phases and cap scope:** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs
