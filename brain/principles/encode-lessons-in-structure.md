# Encode Lessons in Structure

Encode recurring fixes in mechanisms (tools, code, metadata, automation) rather than textual instructions. Every error, human correction, and unexpected outcome is a learning signal — capture it, route it, and close the loop.

**Why:** Textual instructions are routinely ignored. They require the reader to notice, remember, and comply. Structural mechanisms — lint rules, metadata flags, runtime checks, automation scripts — enforce the rule without cooperation.

**Pattern:**
When you catch yourself writing the same instruction a second time:
1. Ask: can this be a lint rule, a metadata flag, a runtime check, or a script?
2. If yes, encode it. Delete the instruction
3. If no (genuinely requires judgment), make the instruction more prominent and add an example of the failure mode

**Corollary:** Don't paper over symptoms. If the fix is structural, ONLY use the structural fix. The instruction IS the symptom.

**Feedback Loop:**
- **Capture every correction:** When the human intervenes or tests fail, decide if it's a one-off or a pattern
- **Route to the right layer:** One-off -> brain note. Recurring fix -> skill or lint rule. Systemic issue -> principle
- **Close the loop:** Don't only record — apply now or create a concrete todo

**Anti-Patterns:**
- Acknowledging without recording ("I'll keep that in mind" does not persist)
- Recording without routing (brain note about a lint rule that should exist is wasted unless the lint rule gets implemented)
- Fixing without generalizing (fixing one instance while leaving the recurring pattern intact)
