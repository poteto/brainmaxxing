# Experience First

The user experience is the product. Every technical decision either serves or hinders it. When a tradeoff exists between implementation convenience and user delight, choose delight.

- Say no to 1,000 things (every feature, control, and option must earn its place)
- Ship less, ship better (polished experience with three features beats rough one with ten)
- Prototype before committing (design decisions are cheaper in throwaway HTML than production code)
- Sweat the details (transitions, alignment, spacing, feedback, error states)
- Tighten the core loop (every feature should serve the central workflow or get out of the way)

Foundations should serve the experience, not the other way around. Foundational thinking governs the *sequence* of work; this principle governs the *target*.
